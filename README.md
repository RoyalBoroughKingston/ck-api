# Connected Kingston

A scheme run by RBK to help residents take control of their own health by connecting them with services and events in their local area.
This system forms the online aspect of this scheme, by providing an API as well a frontend and backend web app.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* PHP
* Composer
* Vagrant

### Installing

Start by cloning the example configuration files and configuring as needed. For more information about configuring the 
`Homestead.yaml` file, please consult the [Laravel Docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/homestead):

```bash
cp Homestead.yaml.example Homestead.yaml
cp .env.example .env

# Installs Laravel Homestead.
composer install --ignore-platform-reqs

# Update your hosts file (use values set in Homestead.yaml).
sudo echo "192.168.10.12 api.connectedkingston.test" >> /etc/hosts
```

You should then be able to start the VM and SSH into it:

```bash
vagrant up && vagrant ssh
cd api.connectedkingston

# Generate the application key.
php artisan key:generate

# Run the migrations and initial seeder.
php artisan migrate --seed

# Install the OAuth 2.0 keys.
php artisan pasport:keys

# Create the first Global Admin user (take a note of the password outputted).
php artisan ck:create-user <first-name> <last-name> <email> <phone-number>
```

Ensure any API clients have been created:

```bash
php artisan passport:client --password --name="Name of Application"
```

## Running the tests
